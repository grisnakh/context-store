# context-store

Easily include boilerplate code for creating a store file that uses the
React Context Hooks.

## What's included

#### Generic file storeGenerator.js
Generic file storeGenerator.js holds the logic of creating a Context provider
with its Reducer function. Both of them come as arguments to accomplish the
re-usability of store generator.

#### Indicative file defaultStore.js
File defaultStore can be copied and placed anywhere in project, typically under stores' directory. Here
we will write all of our state variables, functions belonging to this store context etc.


> ####Note:
> This is not a ready to use package. Useful files are included in our project. Editing them accordingly
can help us use the power of React hooks.
